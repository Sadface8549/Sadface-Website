        <p>Through thick and thin this website is the fruition of my dedication. Starting from knowing absolutely nothing to being able to build and design this functional website has been quite a trip.</p>
        <p>Thanks for tagging along!</p>

        <p>My name is Josh, and this is my story.  </p>

   <div class="text">
        <p>My story starts with me sitting on my bed loading up my first anime, Sword Art Online. Seeing Kirito 
            battle his way through the virtual world of Aincrad and finally escape; ignited my passion for 
            working with computers. The day I enrolled in my first Python course at high school I knew that this was what I 
            loved. They say it takes years to figure out your passion career, I suppose I got lucky. 
        </p>
        <p>With college right around the corner, I had to choose which path I took. The programming path or the networking path.
            I took the latter option and learned so much. I was comfortable with networking, and it came to me very easily, however, it was always lacking something. For my capstone project, I decided to take a leap and make a website, to code again.
            This website is the foundation of that and the ignition to keep pursuing programming. They say to follow your dreams,
            and that's what I'll do; However, this time that choice isn't an option anymore. I'll work to become a professional 
            programmer and networker. Because, <strong>Life is not a game of luck. If you wanna win, work hard! -Sora</strong>

    <h1><strong>How can you move forward if you keep regretting the past? -Edward Elric</strong></h1>
   </div>

   <div class="text">
    <p>I've made my fair share of mistakes and trouble. For the longest time, these held me down and made me lose sight of life.
        There is a secret to life that no one will tell you. Be yourself and do what you have to do to become the best version of yourself.
        That starts with forgiving yourself and realizing that your past isn't what defines who you are, but instead is how you act now. 
        Only after forgiving yourself can, you truly move forward.
